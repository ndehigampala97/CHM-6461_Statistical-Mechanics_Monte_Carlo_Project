# CHM 6461 Monte Carlo Polymer Project (Work in Progress)



This repository contains my ongoing implementation of a 2D lattice polymer Monte Carlo simulation.



Current progress:

- Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW) model implemented

- Move set: end move, corner flip, crankshaft

- Observables: end-to-end distance (R), radius of gyration (Rg), contact count

- VMD trajectory output (XYZ) for visualization



Next steps:

- Add HP model energy and Metropolis acceptance

- Temperature sweep and heat capacity calculation



Note: Output files (plots/CSV/trajectories) are intentionally not tracked.
